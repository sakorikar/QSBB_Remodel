In a paper published in 1908 Minkowski reformulated Einstein's 1905 paper by introducing the four-dimensional (space-time*) non-Euclidean geometry, a step which Einstein did not think much of at the time. But more important is the attitude or philosophy that Minkowski, Hilbert, Klein, and Weyl pursued, namely, that purely mathematical considerations, including harmony and elegance of ideas, should dominate in embracing new physical facts. <em> Mathematics so to speak was to be master and physical theory could be made to bow to the master. </em> [my emphasis] Put otherwise, theoretical physics was a subdomain of mathematical physics, which in turn was a sub-discipline of pure mathematics.\"\n",
